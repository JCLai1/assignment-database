# Gym Management System
Exercise is an important part of healthy lifestyle. Exercise makes our body feel more refreshed and energized. Gym club is a great place for fitness. Exercising in the gym have a lot of benefits such as good exercise environment and wide range of equipment to use. Since then, the gym is crowed with people and a great VMS (Visitor Management System) is needed for better management.
VMS is a professional appearance to enhance security and meet compliance mandates for the collection auditing data of visitor. This system helps to easily screen and track visitors to their building.

In this system, we are having three actor which are the owner of the club, the organization’s workers and the members of the club. The primary actor is the member or customers of the gym while the owner or worker is the secondary actor. In this case, owner have the accessibility to create or delete members, update membership, view all members’ information and add worker details. For the workers, the system allows them to manage members such as add or delete, extend memberships and view memberships. The workers are also allowed to manage their own account. Our gym management allows members to check in to the gym, view their information and fill in their details.
